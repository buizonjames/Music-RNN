class AudioBeats(object):
    r"""Basic class to represent a sample point.

    An `AudioBeats` object doesn't contain any data, but points to the right
    files and has many useful methods to precompute some of the data. They are
    meant to be the items of the pytorch Dataset class `AudioBeatsDataset` to
    train the `BeatFinder` model.

    An `AudioBeats` object represents a section of an audio file (possibly
    stretched) together with the beats (a sequence of times), the onsets, the
    subset of those onsets which are beats, and the spectrogram of the audio.
    The method `precompute` computes the spetrograms, onsets, and the onsets
    that are beats and store this information in files so that it can be quickly
    accessed during training.

    Arguments:
        audio_file (str): The relative path of the full audio file.
        beats_file (str): The relative path of the files containing the beats of
            `audio_file`. This is a `txt` file containing a single column of
            floating point numbers which are the times of the beat track (ground
            truth).
        spec_file (str): The relative path of the file where the spectrogram
            is stored upon calling `precompute_spec()`. This should be a `.npy`
            file. The enclosing directory will be created if it doesn't already
            exists.
        onsets_file (str): The relative path of the file which stores the onsets
            (in units of frames) together with whether they are beats. This is
            a `.csv` file with two columns: the onsets' frames and a column of
            0s and 1s.
        stretch (float): The amount by which to stretch the audio (without
            changing the pitch). For example, if `stretch=2`, the AudioBeats
            object represents a section of the same audio file, but twice
            slower.
        offset (float): The starting point of the sample in the stretched audio
            file.
        duration (float): The duration of the audio in seconds.
        length (int): The duration of the audio in samples (at the sampling rate
            determined in `constants.py`).
        song_duration (float): The duration (in seconds) of the full audio file
            after stretching.
        name (str): The name of the AudioBeats object.

class AudioBeatsDatasetFromSong(AudioBeatsDataset):
    r"""An `AudioBeatsDataset` consisting of equally spaced `AudioBeats` of the
    same duration and completely covering a given audio file.

    Arguments:
        audio_file (str): The path of the audio file.
        beats_file (str): The path of the file containing all the beats (in
        seconds) in the audio file (a `.txt` file with one column of floats).
        precomputation_path (str): The directory where the data pointed by the
            `AudioBeats` objects is stored.
        transform (object): Transform of the `AudioBeatsDataset`.
        duration (float): The duration of the audio pointed by each
            `AudioBeats`.
        stretch (float): The amount by which to stretch the audio.
        force_nb_samples (int or None): By default (if `None`) there will be as
            many `AudioBeats` as possible, side-by-side starting from time
            zero, until no `AudioBeats` can fit in the full audio. Hence, there
            might be a small portion (of length < duration) at the end not
            covered by any `AudioBeats`. If `force_nb_samples` is set to a
            larger number, there will be more `AudioBeats` with zero padding.
            This is useful when we have a large list of, e.g., ~30 seconds
            audio files and want to split each of them in three `AudioBeats`.
            We set `force_nb_samples = 3` so that even if an audio file is
            slightly less or slightly more than 30 seconds we always get 3
            samples (possibly with some zero padding on the right of the last
            one).
        song_offset (float): Starting point of the unstretched song.
        song_duration (float): Duration of the unstretched song.
